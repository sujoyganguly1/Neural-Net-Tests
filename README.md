# Neural-Net-Tests
The ipython codes I wrote to learn and test neural nets, with a focus of using convolutional neural nets for image analysis/classification

# Basic_data_seg
This code is a neural network with on hidden layer and back propogation that I wrote from 'scratch'. 

# CNN_test
This code is a simple convolutional neural net with 2 layers, and dropouts that I wrote using the lasagne (nolearn) package
The code is designed to classify the mnist data set.

# Facial Key Point
This code is a CNN for facial keypoint analysis. We use the kaggle data set for this network. Furthermore, we built this network with three convolutional layers, three pooling layers and two hidden layers with no dropouts.
This should be improved in a newer version to be run on the workstation with dropouts.
