# Neural-Net-Tests
The ipython codes I wrote to learn and test neural nets, with a focus of using convolutional neural nets for image analysis/classification

# Basic_data_seg
This code is a neural network with on hidden layer and back propogation that I wrote from 'scratch'. 

# CNN_test
This code is a simple convolutional neural net with 2 layers, and dropouts that I wrote using the lasagne (nolearn) package
The code is designed to classify the mnist data set.
